# scientific-calculator
A calculator I made in Java last year. Parses the expression into a tree then uses Depth-first to compute the result. Supports most operations. New operations can be added easily.

## Compiling

You need to have Java Development Kit installed in order to compile the source files.

```bash
javac *.java
```

## Usage

```bash
java CalculatorApplication
```
